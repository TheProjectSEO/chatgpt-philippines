## Writing Principles

### 1. Write Like You Talk

**The Test**: Read your content out loud. If it sounds stiff or unnatural, rewrite it.

```
❌ Formal/Stiff:
"HeyGPT facilitates seamless communication through our advanced AI interface."

✅ Natural/Conversational:
"Just type what you need. HeyGPT gets it."
```

### 2. One Idea Per Sentence

**Long, complex sentences are exhausting to read.**

```
❌ Too Complex:
"HeyGPT is a comprehensive AI assistant that provides users with the ability
to engage in natural language conversations, check grammar, detect AI-generated
content, and access a variety of other productivity-enhancing features."

✅ Clear & Scannable:
"HeyGPT is your AI assistant for everything:
- Chat naturally in Filipino or English
- Check grammar and spelling
- Detect AI-generated content
- Boost your productivity"
```

### 3. Active Voice > Passive Voice

**Active voice is more direct and engaging.**

```
❌ Passive:
"Your message will be analyzed by our AI"

✅ Active:
"Our AI analyzes your message"

❌ Passive:
"Errors in your text can be detected"

✅ Active:
"We'll catch errors in your text"
```

### 4. Specific > Vague

**Give concrete examples, not abstract concepts.**

```
❌ Vague:
"HeyGPT helps with various tasks"

✅ Specific:
"HeyGPT helps you:
- Write emails faster
- Study for exams
- Translate Tagalog to English
- Fix grammar mistakes"

❌ Vague:
"Save time on everyday tasks"

✅ Specific:
"Write that work email in 30 seconds, not 30 minutes"
```

### 5. Benefits > Features

**People don't care about your technology. They care about what it does for them.**

```
❌ Feature-focused:
"Powered by GPT-4 architecture with 175B parameters"

✅ Benefit-focused:
"Smart enough to understand context and give you exactly what you need"

❌ Feature-focused:
"Real-time grammar checking with advanced NLP"

✅ Benefit-focused:
"Never send a message with a typo again"
```

### 6. Short Words > Long Words

**Don't use a fancy word when a simple one works.**

```
❌ utilize → ✅ use
❌ facilitate → ✅ help
❌ implement → ✅ set up
❌ leverage → ✅ use
❌ optimize → ✅ improve
❌ enhance → ✅ make better
```

## Content Types

### Headlines

#### Formula: Benefit + Specificity + Emotion

```
❌ Generic:
"AI Chat Platform"

✅ Benefit + Specific:
"Your AI Assistant for Philippines"

❌ Feature-focused:
"Advanced AI Technology"

✅ Benefit + Emotion:
"Chat with AI That Actually Gets You"

❌ Corporate:

```

**Rules**:
- 5-10 words maximum
- Don't use "we", "our", "I" in headlines
- No punctuation at the end (except ? if asking question)
- Test: Remove every unnecessary word

### Subheadlines

#### Formula: Expand on headline + Add specificity + Include CTA hint

```
Headline: "Your AI Assistant for Philippines"

❌ Weak Subheadline:
"A powerful tool for productivity"

✅ Strong Subheadline:
"Chat naturally in Filipino or English. Get instant answers, write better,
and boost your productivity - absolutely free."
```

**Rules**:
- 15-30 words
- Add details the headline couldn't include
- End with a benefit or call to action direction
- One comma maximum (two is too many)

### Button Copy

```
❌ Generic:
"Submit"
"Click Here"
"Learn More"

✅ Specific + Clear:
"Start Free Chat"
"Check My Grammar"
"Sign Up Free"
"Get Started - No Card Required"

✅ Context-specific:
// On pricing page:
"Start 7-Day Trial"

// On chat limit modal:
"Unlock Unlimited Chats"

// On grammar checker:
"Check Grammar Now"
```

**Rules**:
- Start with action verb
- 1-4 words ideal
- No "Click here" or "Submit" ever
- Make it specific to what happens next

### Microcopy

**Tiny text that makes a huge difference**

```

"Type here"

✅ Helpful:
// Chat input:
"Ask me anything... (e.g., 'Write an email in Filipino')"

// Email input:
"name@example.com"

// Search:
"Search your chats..."
```

#### Helper Text

```

"By continuing, you agree to our Terms of Service"

✅ Human:
"We'll never spam you or sell your data. Promise."
```

```
❌ Sad/Negative:
"No messages found"
"Nothing here"

✅ Encouraging:
"Your chat history is empty... for now!
Start your first conversation to see it here."

❌ Just descriptive:
"No saved chats"

✅ Actionable:
"You haven't saved any chats yet.
Star your favorite conversations to find them here."
```

"Yes! HeyGPT works on:
- iPhone and Android phones
- iPad and tablets
- Mac and Windows computers
- Any device with a web browser"
```

## Filipino Market Considerations

### Language Mixing (Code-Switching)

**Filipino users naturally mix Tagalog and English. Your content should reflect this.**

```
✅ Natural mixing:
"Chat in Tagalog or English - kahit ano!"
"Get instant answers para sa lahat ng tanong mo"
"Walang bayad, forever free"

❌ Forced/unnatural:
"Mag-chat sa Tagalog o English"
(100% Tagalog feels formal for a tech product)
```

**When to use Filipino words**:
- Common phrases everyone knows
- Emotional words (mas feel, ang ganda, sayang)
- Cultural references (OFW, balikbayan, pasalubong)

**When to use English**:
- Technical terms (AI, grammar checker, chat)
- New concepts without good Tagalog equivalent
- When Filipino translation is longer/unclear

### Cultural Context

#### Use Filipino Examples

```
❌ Western-centric:
"Write your Thanksgiving email..."
"Prepare for your SATs..."

✅ Filipino context:
"Write your birthday greeting for Tita..."
"Prepare for your college entrance exams..."
"Plan your Pasko shopping list..."
```

#### Address Filipino Pain Points

```
✅ Relevant:
"Perfect for OFWs staying connected with family"
"Great for BPO workers writing emails"
"Helps students with homework and thesis"
"Makes online selling easier (perfect for FB sellers)"
```

#### Pricing in Context

```
❌ Just numbers:
"₱549.95 per month"

✅ With context:
"₱549.95 per month - less than a week of coffee"
"₱19/day - cheaper than your daily pamasahe"
```

### Formality Level

**Filipino culture values respect, but tech products can be friendly**

```
✅ Friendly but respectful:
"Ready to try it? Let's go!"
"Need help? We're here for you."

❌ Too casual:
"Yo, check this out!"
"Sup? Sign up na!"

❌ Too formal:
"We would be honored if you would consider..."
"It would be our pleasure to assist you..."
```

## SEO vs. User Experience

### The Balance

**SEO is important, but user experience comes first.**

#### Do This ✅

```
<h1>Chat with AI in Filipino & English | Free Forever</h1>

Why it works:
- Clear benefit for users
- Includes keywords naturally
- Makes sense when read aloud
```

#### Don't Do This ❌

```
<h1>AI Chat Filipino English Free Chat GPT Philippines AI Assistant</h1>

Why it's bad:
- Keyword stuffing
- Doesn't make sense to humans
- Google penalizes this
```

### Meta Descriptions

**Write for humans first, search engines second**

```
❌ Keyword-stuffed:
"HeyGPT AI chat free Philippines Filipino English chat GPT AI assistant
online chat free AI Philippines Tagalog"

✅ Natural & compelling:
"Chat with AI in Filipino or English. Get instant answers, write better,
and boost productivity - 100% free. Perfect for Filipino users."
```

**Rules**:
- 150-160 characters
- Include primary keyword once
- Focus on benefits and CTA
- Make people want to click

### URL Structure

```
✅ Good URLs:
heygpt.ph/chat
heygpt.ph/grammar-checker
heygpt.ph/pricing

❌ Bad URLs:
heygpt.ph/page1.html
heygpt.ph/product-ai-chat-filipino
heygpt.ph/en/tools/grammar/checker/index
```

---

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Corporate Speak

**Don't sound like a press release.**

```
❌ Corporate:
"HeyGPT is pleased to announce the availability of our revolutionary
AI-powered communication platform designed to facilitate seamless
digital interactions."

✅ Human:
"HeyGPT is here. Chat with AI for free."
```

### 2. Fake Enthusiasm

**Don't use excessive exclamation marks or ALL CAPS.**

```
❌ Overdone:
"WOW!!! This is AMAZING!!! You'll LOVE this INCREDIBLE feature!!!"

✅ Genuine:
"This feature is pretty cool. It helps you work faster."
```

### 3. Marketing Fluff

**Every word should add value. Remove filler.**

```
❌ Fluff:
"In today's fast-paced digital landscape, innovative solutions are
needed to empower users to..."

✅ Direct:
"Work faster with AI."

❌ Fluff:
"We're excited to offer you a best-in-class experience..."

✅ Direct:
"HeyGPT is fast, smart, and easy to use."
```

### 4. Assuming Knowledge

**Don't use jargon without explanation.**

```
❌ Assumes too much:
"Leveraging GPT-4 architecture with transformer-based NLP"

✅ Explains clearly:
"Powered by the same AI that makes ChatGPT smart"

❌ Assumes too much:
"Supports OAuth 2.0 authentication"

✅ Explains clearly:
"Sign in with Google or Facebook - quick and secure"
```

### 5. Apologizing Too Much

**Be confident. Don't say sorry for nothing.**

```
❌ Over-apologetic:
"Sorry to bother you, but would you maybe like to try..."

✅ Confident:
"Ready to try it free?"

❌ Over-apologetic:
"We're sorry, but unfortunately this feature..."

✅ Clear:
"This feature isn't available yet, but here's what you can do..."
```
