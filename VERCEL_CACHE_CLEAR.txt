PRODUCTION FIX NEEDED: Clear Vercel build cache

The timestamp error is still showing because Vercel is serving cached/old code.

HOW TO FIX:

Option 1: Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings → General
4. Scroll to "Build & Development Settings"
5. Toggle "Build Cache" OFF
6. Click "Save"
7. Go to Deployments
8. Click "..." on latest deployment
9. Select "Redeploy"
10. Check "Use existing build cache" is UNCHECKED

Option 2: Force Redeploy
1. Make a small change (add comment to any file)
2. Commit: git commit -am "Force rebuild - clear cache"
3. Push: git push origin main

Option 3: Vercel CLI
vercel --force

The fix IS in the code (commit 164c609), but Vercel needs cache cleared to rebuild.
